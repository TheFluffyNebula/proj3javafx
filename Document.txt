--Exceptions created--
NumberFormatException (I only have two textboxes that take integers)
happens when the user enters anything that's not an integer, ex. decimals and strings

ZeroNumberException
happens when the user enters a number <= 0

Visual bug: too many dice/sides will cause the numbers to go off screen
Exception for that: HighNumberException
New requirements: 
Number of Dice: up to 20
Number of Sides: up to 200
